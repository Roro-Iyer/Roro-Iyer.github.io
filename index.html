<h1>My CPE 471 Project</h1>
<h2>The Endless Hallway</h2>
<p>For my project, I decided to create an endless hallway which a player can walk down using the r key. I decided on this project because I realized the OpenGL system
    provided a lot of control over the position and orientation of an object within the world. This level of control and the ability to dynamically alter the placements of items
    based on other elements of the scene, informed the direction I would take my project. An infinite hallway illusion is a fairly straightforward effect to do in most 3D modeling softwares.
    However it is difficult to make all the objects interface with one another in a way that ensures minimal glitches and bugs. I decided that I would try and tackle this challenge
    and attempt to make an interactable infinite hallway for my final project.
